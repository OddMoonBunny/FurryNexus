### **Final Debugging & Fix Prompt: Ensure NSFW and AI-Generated Content Toggles Persist, Save Correctly, and Apply Consistently**  

**"Fix the NSFW and AI-generated content toggles and the 'Save Profile' functionality so that user preferences persist correctly across page refreshes, navigation, and sessions.  

## **Current Issues:**
1. **Toggles Reset Incorrectly:**
   - Changing NSFW/AI settings does not always persist when switching pages.
   - After a refresh, NSFW content disappears, and AI content is enabled instead.
   - Preferences do not load correctly on the gallery page after toggling settings.

2. **Save Profile Button Does Not Work:**
   - Clicking 'Save Profile' does not store NSFW/AI preferences in the database.
   - No API request is made when saving, or the request does not include updated preferences.
   - Even if saved, the settings are not reflected on the profile after clicking save.

3. **API and Database Issues:**
   - The `/api/user` endpoint does not return NSFW and AI preferences.
   - User preferences are not consistently stored or retrieved from the database.
   - The gallery page does not fetch both `showNsfw` and `showAiGenerated` together, causing settings to apply incorrectly.

## **Required Fixes:**
âœ… **Frontend Fixes:**
- Ensure toggles **send an API request** to update user preferences when changed.
- Modify `use-auth.tsx` to **fetch and apply user preferences on page load.**
- Update the gallery page API requests to **always use the latest stored user preferences.**
- Ensure the toggles correctly **reflect the saved state after clicking 'Save Profile'.**
- After saving, **fetch the updated settings** and update UI without requiring a refresh.

âœ… **Backend Fixes:**
- Modify `/api/user` to **return `showNsfw` and `showAiGenerated` settings** alongside user data.
- Ensure `updateUserPreferences()` **correctly updates** the database.
- Verify that settings are **retrieved and applied in all API responses.**

âœ… **Expected Behavior After Fix:**
- **Clicking 'Save Profile' correctly updates NSFW and AI-generated settings.**
- **Settings persist after page refresh, navigation, and logout/login.**
- **Gallery applies the correct filters based on user preferences.**
- **The Den remains unaffected, always displaying all user artwork.**
- **API always returns the correct NSFW/AI preferences when fetching user data.**  

This fix ensures that **settings are properly saved, retrieved, and applied consistently across the entire site.**" ðŸš€**
